# Mid-Day
During my last 3 weeks at Skylab Coders Academy I had to develop a full stack application, and this is what I came up with, Mid day, an application that connects customers with short time to have lunch with restaurants offering lunch menus.


# Stack

 - Frontend
  · Typescript
  · React-native
  · Redux
  
 - Backend
  · Typescript
  · Node.js
  · Express
  · Mongoose

# Information
Even though I'm really proud of the final product, having a clean code and following a logic, organized process was were i put all my effort. That is why I tried to implement best practices, following SOLID principles and TDD.
