# Mid-Day
During my last 3 weeks at Skylab Coders Academy I had to develop a full stack application, and this is what I came up with, Mid day, an application that connects customers with short time to have lunch with restaurants offering lunch menus.


## Stack

 - Frontend
  - Typescript
  - React-native
  - Redux
  
 - Backend
  - Typescript
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Mongoose

## Information
Even though I'm really proud of the final product, having a clean code and following a logic, organized process was were i put all my effort. That is why I tried to implement best practices, following SOLID principles and TDD.
